                        <br>
                        <p> If you're looking for some delicious hams, look no further than your local school. 
                            Girls at the ages of 10–15 and boys at the ages of 10–12 have perfectly sized thighs 
                            that make excellent meals. Simply add spices and sugar and voila. Calves also make 
                            good drumsticks. Breaded, fried, oiled, buttered, and plane taste phenomenal. Males 
                            tend to have tough calves that may be chewy, especially to me. However, for softer 
                            sweeter, and sometimes juicier meat, look for girls. Athletes tend to have more leg 
                            meat thus more food. Soccer players, cheerleaders, gymnasts, runners, etc. all have 
                            perfect leg meat.</p>

                        <h2>Potatos and Debra:</h2>
                        <br>
                        <ol>
                            <ul> 1 Debra (preferably 5ft long and 2ft wide) </ul>
                            <ul> 12 potatoes </ul>
                            <ul> 250 liters of human hair oil </ul>
                            <ul> 2 lemons </ul>
                            <ul> 5 cups of flour </ul>
                            <ul> 10 eggs </ul>
                            <ul> 8 cups of milk </ul>
                            <ul> 50 grams of butter </ul>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        <p>First, skin your Debra and place it in a large container. Run warm water through your 
                            Debra and drain. Leave your Debra in a large oven at 350 degrees fan for 1 hour. Add 
                            eggs, milk, butter, lemon, and flour into a bowl and mix well. Chop up potatoes into 
                            long strips and coat with the mixture. Leave the mixture in the fridge. Take Debra out 
                            of the oven and let them cool. Coat your Debra with the mixture. (the best way to do 
                            it is to dip your hands into the mixture and massage his body) Pour your oil into a large 
                            container and heat. Once the oil starts bubbling, gently put your Debra into the oil. 
                            Cook until golden brown. Cut into 6 parts. Fry your potato strip for 1 minute and arrange 
                            it on the plate.</p>
